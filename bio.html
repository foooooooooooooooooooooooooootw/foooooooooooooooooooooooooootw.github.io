    <h3>Roots</h3>
    <p>Ethnically, most of my ancestors come from South China. Although I may not look like it, Nanyang is where my family has been for generations. My birth cert reads "Hainanese", but that discounts the rest of my bloodline which includes cantonese, teochew and even a tiny bit of persian.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From a religious standpoint, I was raised Methodist. Most of my nuclear family converted spontaneously to Christianity at different times, and to different denominations; but most notably Catholic and Baptist.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I used to be told stories of how my great-grandfather was a warlord, my grandfather a volunteer soldier, etc. It would seem I come from a line of people that were forced to take up arms before conscription was even a thing. I suppose I should be grateful that there seems to be regional peace; that I was spared that fate - even if that peace is a result of uneasy truces.</p>

    <h3>Genesis</h3>
    <p>I was born to 2 lawyers. Although I aspired to be like my parents at a young age, they quickly dissuaded me and told me to stay away from law. 
      I can understand why. They would leave the home everyday before the sun rose, and only return long after the sun had set. This would mean I was put under the care
      of my grandparents, who lived in a nice big cul-de-sac right on the edge of the forest. My younger years were spent surrounded by nature, and relatively isolated compared 
      to most kids my age. A dog named Bonnie raised me alongside my grandparents, and we used to harvest our own fruits for consumption.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/bonnie.jpg" alt="Bonnie" class="responsive-image-2" style="border-radius: 20px;">
      <br>
      <p>Snakes, frogs and all sorts of fauna would often creep into our backyard despite our attempts to keep nature's interlopers out. Despite the short spans
      of time I was able to spend with my parents, they had influenced me greatly. This can be seen from the way I speak, which often ends in me being accused of being a foreigner.
      I was once verbally assaulted for "using big words" and showing off, despite having no intention to. My parents, both skilled interlocutors (or interrogators I suppose) in their own way,
      had unintentionally passed many of their speech patterns to me. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My father taught me the value of keeping your cards close to your chest, not mincing words, to view a situation from every conceivable angle and to never speak in absolutes. His piercing gaze
      combined with his rigid stance and short phrases exerted a lot of pressure. He radiated a chilling aura which froze his opponents in their tracks. He wielded his words like 
      a scalpel - surgical; precise; targeted.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My mother would show me the opposite. To puff out your chest, to give no chance for the other side to speak, to have your blood boil and breathe fire, all while having the tone of irritation in your voice.
      Whenever I objected to her, it was like throwing coal into a furnace. She always wanted the last word. My mental image of her would be a tank firing shells as it drove straight into gunfire. 
      Strident. Fiery. 
    </p>
    <br> 
    <p>And where fire and ice met, there I was. How these two forces of nature ever got along in the first place has always been a mystery to me. Of course, it's not all bad. They're also my role models for different reasons.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My father could speak 4 or 5 languages, and that was always incredibly impressive to me as a child. To see him talk to people who were completely different is part of the reason why I value language skills so much. He would cook dishes I considered
      "exotic" - like a whole turkey; which inspired me to learn recipes of my own. My mother was charitable, and would always give to people who were needy. She'd always tell me to give whatever I could, especially to people who had much less than us. She was also a painter, following in her father's footsteps,
      which made me able to appreciate a nice oil on canvas.

    <h3>Teenage years</h3>
    <p>My teenage years were no easier. I felt excluded a lot of the time because I was different in many ways. Not just how I spoke or looked, but my interests were wildly different from the other kids.
      I had taken up business studies, and my command of the english language had grown greatly. I had envisioned taking up some sort of business or arts degree in the future, but again my parents put a stop to 
      it very quickly. I was told to take up something in a STEM field, and I ended up taking Marine Engineering since I live in a port city. I really enjoyed engineering, and although it imparted many useful skills,
      the thought of being at sea for months at a time really put me off. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Soon after, I found myself in the military as a conscript. When I finished my basic military training, there was a newfound bitterness in my heart. I was unable to vote yet I was being trained to kill and die for my country.
      I saw my brothers-in-arms being treated badly, shouted at, put to their breaking point. Conditioned to take orders and throw ourselves into gunfire. This would go on to alter my perception on a lot of things.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Later on, I would seek to switch fields. Computers were my hobby, and I had programmed from a young age. As such, I wanted to formalize it and get a degree. Fortunately, James Cook University would take me in and give me a substantial grant which I am very grateful for.
      Although my time there was uneventful since I was already adept at IT before even stepping foot into the school, I was granted the opportunity to make friends with many international students. Many of the friends I made there were from Myanmar which 
      gave me insight into the terrible happenings in their country, alongside the intricacies and delicacies their culture had to offer. If you've never tried food from myanmar, I must recommend fried roselle salad.

    <h3>The Present</h3>
    <p>After graduating from the IT degree, I sought again to become even more... erudite. The basic degree was wide, in that it covered everything from programming to content management and data mining. After jumping through numerous hoops and taking the GRE,
      I would be admitted into Singapore Management University, under the MITB (FTA) Masters degree. Supposedly, its the 2nd best in Asia under Global Master's in Business Analytics. I'd entered this postgraduate degree at about 25 years old, which meant my cohort
      all had years of experience under their belt. And while the rigor of the syllabus was definitely unparalleled insofar as I'd come across, I learnt a lot from the friends I had made. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Today, I see myself as someone who is self-motivated, unafraid to form friendships, and an unwavering duty to upholding my values.</p>
    <br><h3 style="text-align: center;">&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EC;&#x1F1F2;&#x1F1FE;&#x1F1F5;&#x1F1ED;&#x1F1F9;&#x1F1FC;&#x1F1FB;&#x1F1F3;&#x1F1F9;&#x1F1ED;&#x1F1EE;&#x1F1E9;&#x1F1F2;&#x1F1F2;</h3>
    <br><p>One thing I care a lot about is creating a strong network of friends across Asia, as I believe we live in an incredibly unstable region where our governments and people are unable to see eye to eye despite the centuries of exposure.
      I run a server with over a hundred people, most from SEA, and my dream is an Asia where we realize if we don't embrace each other we will be exploited for the rest of time. If you're interested in making friends, feel free to reach out!
