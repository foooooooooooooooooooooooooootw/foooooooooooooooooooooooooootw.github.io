    <h3>Roots</h3>
    <p>Ethnically, most of my ancestors come from South China. Although I may not look like it, Nanyang is where my family has been for generations. My birth cert reads "Hainanese", but that discounts the rest of my bloodline which includes cantonese, teochew and even a tiny bit of persian.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From a religious standpoint, I was raised Methodist. Most of my nuclear family converted spontaneously to Christianity at different times, and to different denominations; but most notably Catholic and Baptist.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Growing up, I was steeped in tales of my family’s history – my great-grandfather a warlord, my grandfather a volunteer soldier, and so on. It seemed my lineage was marked by a recurring need to take up arms, long before conscription became commonplace. I find myself grateful for the relative peace of my time, a peace that feels almost like a reprieve from that potentially violent legacy – even if it’s built on uneasy truces.</p>

    <h3>Genesis</h3>
    <p>I was born into a family of lawyers, and as a child, I wholeheartedly admired their dedication. However, my parents quickly steered me away from the legal profession, recognizing perhaps that it wasn't a path for me. They would often disappear before the sun rose and return long after it had set, leaving me in the care of my grandparents. They lived in a beautiful cul-de-sac right on the edge of the forest, and my early years were spent immersed in nature, relatively isolated from other children my age. A wonderful dog named Bonnie was a constant companion, and we even learned to harvest our own fruits together.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/bonnie.jpg" alt="Bonnie" class="responsive-image-2" style="border-radius: 20px;">
      <br>
      <p>Snakes, frogs and all sorts of fauna would often creep into our backyard despite our attempts to keep nature's interlopers out. Despite the limited time I spent with my parents, their influence on my communication style is undeniable. I’ve been occasionally described as speaking with a ‘foreign’ accent, likely a reflection of their own vocabulary & accent. I was once criticized for ‘showing off’ with my use of complex language, though I had no intention to do so. My parents, skilled interlocutors (or interrogators, perhaps) themselves, had inadvertently instilled in me a tendency towards articulate expression.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My father instilled in me a fundamental distrust of openness. He taught me to keep my cards close to my chest, to analyze every conceivable angle, and to avoid absolute statements. His icy, piercing gaze, combined with his rigid stance and laconic speech, exerted a palpable pressure – a chilling aura that froze his opponents. He wielded his words like a scalpel, surgical and precise.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My mother operated on a fundamentally different principle. She taught me to puff out my chest, to hit them with a flurry of words, to allow my blood to boil and to breathe fire – all delivered with a tone of unmistakable irritation. Whenever we found ourselves toe to toe, my objections were like throwing coal into a furnace, a futile gesture against her unwavering determination. My mental image of her was a tank firing shells, relentlessly driving into the face of gunfire. Strident. Fiery.
    </p>
    <br> 
    <p>And where fire and ice met, there I was. How these two forces of nature ever got along in the first place has always been a mystery to me. Yet, despite their differences, they both served as my role models, albeit for vastly different reasons.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>As a child, I was consistently impressed by my father’s fluency in four or five languages – witnessing his conversations with people from vastly different backgrounds instilled in me a deep appreciation for language skills. He also introduced me to a world of exotic flavors, preparing dishes like roast turkey. My mother, meanwhile, was deeply charitable, always encouraging me to give generously, particularly to those less fortunate than ourselves. She, like her father before her, was a painter, and her beautiful oil paintings fostered my own appreciation for the art form.

    <h3>Teenage years</h3>
    <p>I felt a constant sense of being an outsider during my teenage years – different in so many ways, not just in how I spoke or looked, but in my interests. I’d been studying business, and my English had improved dramatically, with ambitions of pursuing a business or arts degree. But again, my parents quickly intervened, urging me towards a STEM field, which led me to Marine Engineering, given my location in a port city. I enjoyed the work, but the idea of being at sea for months at a time really put me off.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Soon after, I found myself in the military as a conscript. When I finished my basic military training, there was a newfound bitterness in my heart.I hadn’t yet gained the right to vote, yet I was being trained to kill and die for my country. I saw my brothers-in-arms being treated poorly, shouted at, and pushed to their limits, conditioned to take orders and throw themselves into gunfire. This would go on to alter my perception on a lot of things.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Later on, I would seek to switch fields. Computers were my hobby, and I had programmed from a young age. As such, I wanted to formalize it and get a degree. Fortunately, James Cook University would take me in and give me a substantial grant which I am very grateful for.
      Although my time there was uneventful since I was already adept at IT before even stepping foot into the school, I was granted the opportunity to make friends with many international students. Many of the friends I made there were from Myanmar which 
      gave me insight into the terrible happenings in their country, alongside the intricacies and delicacies their culture had to offer. If you've never tried food from myanmar, I must recommend fried roselle salad.

    <h3>The Present</h3>
    <p>After graduating from the IT degree, I sought again to become even more... erudite. The basic degree was wide, in that it covered everything from programming to content management and data mining. After jumping through numerous hoops and taking the GRE,
      I would be admitted into Singapore Management University, under the MITB (FTA) Masters degree. Supposedly, its the 2nd best in Asia under Global Master's in Business Analytics. I'd entered this postgraduate degree at about 25 years old, which meant my cohort
      all had years of experience under their belt. And while the rigor of the syllabus was definitely unparalleled insofar as I'd come across, I learnt a lot from the friends I had made. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Today, I see myself as someone who is self-motivated, unafraid to form friendships, and an unwavering duty to upholding my values.</p>
    <br><h3 style="text-align: center;">&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EC;&#x1F1F2;&#x1F1FE;&#x1F1F5;&#x1F1ED;&#x1F1F9;&#x1F1FC;&#x1F1FB;&#x1F1F3;&#x1F1F9;&#x1F1ED;&#x1F1EE;&#x1F1E9;&#x1F1F2;&#x1F1F2;</h3>
    <br><p>One thing I care a lot about is creating a strong network of friends across Asia, as I believe we live in an incredibly unstable region where our governments and people are unable to see eye to eye despite the centuries of exposure.
      I run a server with over a hundred people, most from SEA, and my dream is an Asia where we realize if we don't embrace each other we will be exploited for the rest of time. If you're interested in making friends, feel free to reach out!
